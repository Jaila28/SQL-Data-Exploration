# SQL-And-Tableau-Data-Exploration
SQL Data Exploration with Visualizations created in Tableau 

## Project Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to answer the following questions and to display the answers by creating Tableau dashboards. I have created 4 visualizations to 
display my findings.

**Question 1.**  What are the total number of cases of the population that was infected, the number of population that died, and the percentage of those who died globally from by Covid-19? 

**Question 2.** Based on the total population infected in each continent, how many total deaths were there and which continent had the lowest amount of deaths occur?

**Question 3.** How many cases of the infected population were estimated or forecasted for the united states from March 2021 to October 2021?
